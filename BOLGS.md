## Week 1: 7.3-7.9
My previous research explored the changes in Chinese strong ties culture in the context of the Internet and found that traditional strong ties were transformed into more multidimensional digital strong ties. In that week's research, I read a lot of literature, and in one of the studies, I pointed out that due to the emergence of the Internet, the traditional Chinese blood ties, geographic ties, karmic ties, and interest relationship have become digital strong ties, and that "interest relationship" are the most emerging and easier group to reach digital strong ties, and I used the interviews with members of gaming and fan circles to deduce and prove a model for the formation of digital strong ties. We reasoned and proved the formation model of digital strong ties, and found that digital strong ties has wider coverage and lower maintenance cost than traditional strong ties.

## Week 2: 7.10-7.16
In that week, I analyzed Dr. Yanjie Bian's definition of traditional strong ties, the process of upgrading weak ties into digital strong ties, and the initial and stable phases of trust building in digital strong ties, and found that trust is like a kind of "social currency" that circulates multidimensionally in individual and group strong ties, because people have to build up enough trust in order to establish digital strong ties in any circumstances, and this kind of digital strong ties must have been born from long-time interactions with multidimensional interactions in the digital platform.

## Week 3: 7.17-7.23
Since trust is like a kind of "social currency", I try to analyze how trust circulates as a kind of currency in digital strong ties in a multi-dimensional way. Through reading the literature and analyzing the traditional strong ties and digital strong ties, I found that the core difference between them lies in the starting point of forming relationship - digital technology, because digital technology and platform are the foundation of the development of digital strong ties, and then rise to the establishment of person-to-person and person-to-group digital strong ties. Therefore, I define the direction of the circulation of trust as "trust-digital technologies and platforms-individuals-groups-results", but the details of the circulation need to be considered in this process.

## Week 4: 7.24-7.30
I think out the direction of the circulation of trust based on last week: trust-digital technologies and platforms-individuals-groups-results, and I try to build a model of the circulation of trust in strong digital ties. Taking trust as the center to disperse outward to the first level - digital technology and platform layer, I read the literature and look back to the previous interviews, and finally found that trust is firstly built up by the reputation of the platform to a certain extent, and the user's interest and interaction with some people in it will be recorded by the data, so as to recommend the corresponding community, and thus may be better able to reach the digital strong ties. In my exploration of other social platforms digital platforms also quantify trust in multiple ways, e.g., in QQ, the two interacting parties automatically set a friendship level by the number of days the chat lasts each day, and when the interaction is interrupted for more than 3 days it is downgraded, which uses the frequency of people's interactions as a way to quantify trust.

In my personal level exploration, I find that people building digital identities in a more authentic, complete, coherent, and sincere way in a secure platform leads to more stable personal trust, deep self-disclosure, and strengthened trust and digitally strong ties with others. From this I find that trust has quantifiable characteristics.

## Week 5: 7.31-8.6
I encountered a lot of difficulties in that week's research, especially in the research on the group level, I have studied a lot of literature on virtual communities, digital identity of groups and other directions, and found that the topic could not be further deepened. So I found a typical "interest relationship" individual around me, and through interviewing her, I found that as fans of celebrities, they are given many digital socialization methods by the platform in their own digital strong ties, and they are also differentiated into obvious grades in the group through the interaction design of the platform, and the higher the grade, the higher the degree of trust they have and the corresponding benefits they will get. The higher the rank, the more trusted they are and the more benefits they receive, and this hierarchy of trust leads to a more orderly digital strong ties community. The rich interaction methods within the community developed by the digital platform will also increase the digital strong ties among the members, such as completing the system tasks together, which will increase the two-way trust and thus better shape the collective identity and culture.
Through Week 4 and Week 5, I found that trust circulates in digital strong ties in ways that can be quantified, facilitate deep socialization over time, the maintenance and shaping of group values, and extend digital strong ties.

## Week 6: 8.7-8.13
The difficult point of the week's research is to dig deeper into the critical direction of the topic, digging over the direction of the entanglement in the digital strong ties of trust fraud, digital strong ties of the causes of instability of social trust, the virtual true and false, whether the trust is fragmented, the digital strong ties of the group polarization, etc., the week has been constantly going to look for breakthroughs, the readings of more than 50 papers.

## Week 7: 8.14-8.20
That week I refreshed all the existing papers to make all the textual content more concise so as to try to find a point of strength for the paper, and eventually realized that all the directions I took last week would make the context incoherent. I looked at all the analytics and found that the trust built in the context of digitally strong ties with interesting people is collected and pushed by algorithmic preferences and built by multiple interaction design mechanisms, which is why I questioned, is the trust built in the context of digitally strong ties pure? Is it all about "free will"? So I started with a simple analysis of the algorithmic guidance of trust and the intervention of interaction design mechanisms, and found that algorithms and recommender systems are constantly guiding the direction of individual social groups based on individual interests and behaviors, and through reading papers, I found that the quantization of trust will turn what should be a rich and colorful trust into a single one-sided tendency of trust hierarchy.

## Week 8: 8.21-8.27
In that week, I analyzed last week's research and read the paper, and found that the platform as the soil for the development of strong digital ties exploits the trust of the digital strong ties of "interest relationship", and I firstly found some practical examples that can prove this speculation, and found that trust is also used for the development of digital platforms and user adhesion, which in fact strengthens the relationship between people and the digital platforms. strong digital ties with digital platforms. In other studies, it has been pointed out that platform capitalism and algorithms change the structure of trust, transforming trust ties into trust capital, which appears to be the result of autonomous decision-making brought about by people's "free will", but is essentially the result of the platform capital's purposeful steering using smart algorithms.

## Week 9: 8.28-9.3
During the week I searched for papers on the platform's trust capital, free will, and the economy of "interest relationship" to support the theory and enrich the overall content and structure of the paper, and to come up with an analysis of all of last week's content, ultimately reflecting on the blurring of the boundaries of people's freedom of trust and the loss of sovereignty over their trust, and reflecting on their perspectives.

## Week 10: 9.4-9.10
During that week, I streamlined any lengthy or unnecessary content in the paper and then summarized the research. Then, I combed through all the cited literature in the research and labeled it with its proper serial number and reordered the article titles of the existing paper.

## Week 11: 9.11-9.17
Based on my research in the previous weeks, I thought about the scenarios and I looked at a range of computer artists such as: Rafael Lozano-Hemmer's "The Listening Post" by Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin - a dynamic art installation that collects and broadcasts text from internet chat rooms in real time. Jenny Holzer's LED installations - Jenny Holzer uses scrolling LED text to convey information, thoughts and social commentary. "Processing" by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. Kyle McDonald's "Social Soul," an immersive, interactive installation that allows users to experience the social media lives of others, and Golan Levin, a new media artist and engineer who often explores the interactions between humans and machines. His works such as "Double-Taker (Snout)" use computer vision and robotics to mimic human social behaviour.

## Week 12: 9.18-9.24
People to "call" behaviour in front of the screen receiver speaker to send their preferences for interaction, the system will automatically match a community point, the more people interact with the community in front of the screen, the coarser the strength of the relationship, next to the interaction to achieve the trust index, and in the strength of the relationship with the algorithm inside! visual elements such as vision, delivery of interactive content, and empathy. But when people stop interacting, the system allows the strength to diminish and people are in a passive interaction process, which is used to satirise the impact of the system on people's "trust" building, until finally the screen plays a film on the evolution of the trust structure of the digital strong ties to make a viewpoint.
